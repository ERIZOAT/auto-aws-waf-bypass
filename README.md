# Automating AWS WAF CAPTCHA Bypass: A Developer's Guide

AWS WAF CAPTCHAs are a common hurdle for automated processes like web scraping, testing, and data collection. This guide provides a comprehensive, developer-centric approach to programmatically bypass these challenges using both browser automation (Puppeteer/Selenium with an extension) and direct API integration. We'll focus on practical examples with CapSolver, a service designed to streamline CAPTCHA resolution.

## Understanding AWS WAF CAPTCHA Mechanisms

AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF) employs CAPTCHAs to distinguish legitimate human traffic from automated bots. These challenges typically fall into two categories:

1.  **Image Recognition:** Users are presented with a grid of images and asked to select those containing specific objects (e.g., 

`chairs`, `cars`).
2.  **Token-Based Verification:** A hidden token is generated and must be acquired and submitted with subsequent requests to prove human interaction.

Both require automated solutions for seamless integration into your workflows.

## Method 1: Browser-Based Automation with CapSolver Extension

For scenarios requiring browser context (e.g., end-to-end testing, complex web interactions), integrating a CAPTCHA-solving browser extension is highly effective. CapSolver offers an extension that automates AWS WAF CAPTCHA resolution.

### Setup: CapSolver Browser Extension

1.  **Download & Install:** Download the [CapSolver extension ZIP](https://docs.capsolver.com/en/guide/extension/settings_for_developers/#how-to-modify-the-configuration-file-and-install) and install it in your browser (Chrome/Firefox) as an unpacked extension.
2.  **Configure `config.js`:** Navigate to the extracted extension folder and locate `/assets/config.js`. Open this file and set your `apiKey` and ensure `enabledForAwsCaptcha` is `true`.

    ```javascript
    // assets/config.js snippet
    const config = {
      apiKey: "YOUR_CAPSOLVER_API_KEY", // Replace with your actual API Key
      // ... other settings ...
      enabledForAwsCaptcha: true,
      // ... other settings ...
    };
    ```

3.  **Parameter Recognition (Optional but Recommended):** To understand the CAPTCHA parameters, open browser developer tools (F12), switch to the `Capsolver Captcha Detector` tab, and trigger the CAPTCHA. The extension will display the required parameters, which can be useful for debugging or direct API calls.

### Integrating with Automation Frameworks

Once configured, the CapSolver extension can be loaded into headless browser environments like Puppeteer or Selenium.

#### Puppeteer (Node.js) Example

This example demonstrates launching Puppeteer with the CapSolver extension loaded. The extension will automatically intercept and solve AWS WAF CAPTCHAs encountered by the browser.

**`puppeteer_aws_waf.js`**
```javascript
const puppeteer = require("puppeteer");

(async () => {
  const pathToExtension = "/path/to/your/capsolver_extension_folder"; // IMPORTANT: Update this path
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch({
    headless: false, // Set to true for production, false for debugging
    args: [
      `--disable-extensions-except=${pathToExtension}`,
      `--load-extension=${pathToExtension}`,
      `--window-size=1920,1080` // Recommended for consistent CAPTCHA rendering
    ],
  });
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  await page.setViewport({ width: 1920, height: 1080 });

  console.log("Navigating to target website...");
  await page.goto("https://your-target-website.com", { waitUntil: "networkidle2" }); // Replace with your AWS WAF protected URL

  // Your automation logic here. The extension will handle CAPTCHAs automatically.
  // Example: Wait for a specific element to appear after CAPTCHA resolution
  // await page.waitForSelector("#content-after-captcha");

  console.log("Page loaded, CAPTCHA should be handled by extension if present.");
  // await browser.close(); // Uncomment to close browser after task
})();
```

#### Selenium (Python) Example

Similarly, Selenium can be configured to load the zipped CapSolver extension, allowing Python-based automation scripts to handle AWS WAF CAPTCHAs.

**`selenium_aws_waf.py`**
```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Options
import time

# IMPORTANT: Ensure capsolver_extension.zip is the zipped version of your configured extension folder
EXTENSION_PATH = "./capsolver_extension.zip" 
TARGET_URL = "https://your-target-website.com" # Replace with your AWS WAF protected URL

def setup_selenium_with_capsolver():
    chrome_options = Options()
    chrome_options.add_extension(EXTENSION_PATH)
    # Optional: Add other options for headless mode or specific user agents
    # chrome_options.add_argument("--headless")
    # chrome_options.add_argument("user-agent=Mozilla/5.0...")
    
    driver = webdriver.Chrome(options=chrome_options)
    driver.set_window_size(1920, 1080) # Recommended for consistent CAPTCHA rendering
    return driver

def main():
    driver = setup_selenium_with_capsolver()
    try:
        print(f"Navigating to {TARGET_URL}...")
        driver.get(TARGET_URL)
        
        # Your automation logic here. The extension will handle CAPTCHAs automatically.
        # Example: Wait for a few seconds or for a specific element
        time.sleep(15) # Give time for CAPTCHA to appear and be solved
        # driver.find_element_by_id("content-after-captcha")
        
        print("Page loaded, CAPTCHA should be handled by extension if present.")
        print("Current URL:", driver.current_url)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
    finally:
        driver.quit()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Method 2: API-Based Integration for Scalable Solutions

For high-throughput, server-side automation, direct API integration with CapSolver is the most efficient method. This approach offers granular control and is ideal for large-scale web scraping, data aggregation, and other demanding tasks. CapSolver supports both image-based and token-based AWS WAF challenges via its API.

### Solving Image-Based AWS WAF CAPTCHA (`AwsWafClassification`)

This task type is designed for image selection CAPTCHAs. You provide the base64 encoded image(s) and the question, and CapSolver returns the solution.

**API Request (`createTask` endpoint):**

```json
// aws_waf_image_request.json
{
  "clientKey": "YOUR_CAPSOLVER_API_KEY",
  "task": {
    "type": "AwsWafClassification",
    "websiteURL": "https://your-target-website.com", // Optional, but improves accuracy
    "images": [
      "/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAgAA..." // Base64 encoded image 1
      // ... more images if it's a grid (up to 9 for aws:grid)
    ],
    "question": "aws:grid:chair" // Example: "aws:toycarcity:carcity" or "aws:grid:bed"
  }
}
```

**Python Example for `AwsWafClassification`:**

```python
import requests
import base64

API_KEY = "YOUR_CAPSOLVER_API_KEY" # Replace with your CapSolver API Key
IMAGE_PATH = "./path/to/your/captcha_image.png" # Path to the CAPTCHA image
QUESTION = "aws:grid:chair" # The question provided by AWS WAF
TARGET_URL = "https://your-target-website.com"

def encode_image_to_base64(image_path):
    with open(image_path, "rb") as image_file:
        return base64.b64encode(image_file.read()).decode("utf-8")

def solve_aws_waf_image_captcha():
    image_base64 = encode_image_to_base64(IMAGE_PATH)
    
    create_task_payload = {
        "clientKey": API_KEY,
        "task": {
            "type": "AwsWafClassification",
            "websiteURL": TARGET_URL,
            "images": [image_base64],
            "question": QUESTION
        }
    }
    
    response = requests.post("https://api.capsolver.com/createTask", json=create_task_payload)
    task_response = response.json()
    
    if task_response.get("errorId") == 0:
        solution = task_response.get("solution")
        print("AWS WAF Image CAPTCHA Solution:", solution)
        return solution
    else:
        print("Error solving CAPTCHA:", task_response)
        return None

if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve_aws_waf_image_captcha()
```

### Solving Token-Based AWS WAF CAPTCHA (`AntiAwsWafTask`)

This task type is for obtaining the `aws-waf-token`. It requires extracting several parameters from the AWS WAF challenge page.

**API Request (`createTask` endpoint):**

```json
// aws_waf_token_request.json
{
  "clientKey": "YOUR_CAPSOLVER_API_KEY",
  "task": {
    "type": "AntiAwsWafTaskProxyLess", // Or AntiAwsWafTask if using your own proxy
    "websiteURL": "https://your-target-website.com",
    "awsKey": "AQIDAHjcYu/GjX+QlghicBg......", // Extracted from page source (e.g., window.gokuProps.key)
    "awsIv": "CgAAFDIlckAAAAid",             // Extracted from page source (e.g., window.gokuProps.iv)
    "awsContext": "7DhQfG5CmoY90ZdxdHCi8WtJ3z......", // Extracted from page source (e.g., window.gokuProps.context)
    "awsChallengeJS": "https://...challenge.js", // Optional, link to challenge.js
    "awsApiJs": "https://...jsapi.js",         // Optional, link to jsapi.js
    "awsProblemUrl": "https://...problem?kind=visual&...", // Optional, for specific problem types
    "awsApiKey": "Sps+L2gV...",               // Optional, for secondary verification
    "awsExistingToken": "5na16dg6-...",         // Optional, for secondary verification
    "proxy": "http:ip:port:user:pass"          // Required if type is AntiAwsWafTask
  }
}
```

**Python Example for `AntiAwsWafTask`:**

```python
import requests
import time

API_KEY = "YOUR_CAPSOLVER_API_KEY" # Replace with your CapSolver API Key
TARGET_URL = "https://efw47fpad9.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/latest" # Example AWS WAF protected URL

# IMPORTANT: These parameters must be dynamically extracted from the target page's source!
# Use browser automation (e.g., Selenium/Puppeteer) to get these values in real-time.
AWS_KEY = "AQIDAHjcYu/GjX+QlghicBg......shMIKvZswZemrVVqA=="
AWS_IV = "CgAAFDIlckAAAAid"
AWS_CONTEXT = "7DhQfG5CmoY90ZdxdHCi8WtJ3z......njNKULdcUUVEtxTk="
# AWS_CHALLENGE_JS = "https://...challenge.js"
# AWS_API_JS = "https://...jsapi.js"

def solve_aws_waf_token_captcha():
    create_task_payload = {
        "clientKey": API_KEY,
        "task": {
            "type": "AntiAwsWafTaskProxyLess", # Use AntiAwsWafTask if you have your own proxy
            "websiteURL": TARGET_URL,
            "awsKey": AWS_KEY,
            "awsIv": AWS_IV,
            "awsContext": AWS_CONTEXT,
            # "awsChallengeJS": AWS_CHALLENGE_JS,
            # "awsApiJs": AWS_API_JS,
            # Add other required aws* parameters based on the specific WAF challenge
        }
    }
    
    response = requests.post("https://api.capsolver.com/createTask", json=create_task_payload)
    task_response = response.json()
    
    if task_response.get("errorId") == 0:
        task_id = task_response.get("taskId")
        print(f"Task created with ID: {task_id}. Polling for result...")
        
        while True:
            time.sleep(5) # Poll every 5 seconds
            get_result_payload = {"clientKey": API_KEY, "taskId": task_id}
            result_response = requests.post("https://api.capsolver.com/getTaskResult", json=get_result_payload)
            result_data = result_response.json()
            
            if result_data.get("status") == "ready":
                aws_waf_token = result_data.get("solution", {}).get("cookie")
                print("AWS WAF Token successfully obtained:", aws_waf_token)
                return aws_waf_token
            elif result_data.get("status") == "processing":
                print("CAPTCHA still processing...")
            else:
                print("Error or failed task:", result_data)
                return None
    else:
        print("Error creating task:", task_response)
        return None

if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve_aws_waf_token_captcha()
```
